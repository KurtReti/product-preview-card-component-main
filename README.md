## My process
- Establish the basic layout with html boxes, using borders to see the layout before adding
the text content.
- Moving on to the CSS to add the proper styling, initially I didn't implement any responsive 
design but I added it later to satisfy the challenge properly, implementing some feedback I 
received on my implementation. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Breakpoint and Boxes
